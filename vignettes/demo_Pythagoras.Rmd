## Pythagoras Info

The pythagoras' theorem (of Pythagorean theorem) is the relationship among the three sides of a right-angled triangle. It states that the sum of the squares of the two smallest sides (in our case called a and b) is equal to the square of the largest side (the side positioned on the opposite of the right angle, which we call c).

## Graphical representation

TODO: ask if it is possible to enter a picture of a triange in here to demonstrate 
the function graphically.

## Example

```{r}
# The function:
Pythagoras <- function(a , b) {
  c <- sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
  c
}

# Side a has a length of 5, side b has a length of 7; put the numbers in the function to compute the length of c.
Pythagoras(5, 7)

```
